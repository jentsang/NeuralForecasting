# HDR ML Challenge year 2: Scientific Modeling out of distribution (Scientific-Mood)

## Problem setting: Neural Forecasting
To forecast the activations of a cluster of neurons given previous signals from the same cluster. This targets the critical problem of brain-artificial neuron interfaces, and these models can be used in brain-chip interfaces for artificial limb control, amongst many others.

## Datasets
The motor neural activity forecasting dataset includes recorded neural signals from two monkeys performing reaching activities, Monkey A and Monkey B, using μECoG arrays. Recorded neural signals are in the form of multivariate continuous time series, with variables corresponding to recording electrodes in the recording array.

The dataset includes all 239 electrodes from Monkey A and 87 electrodes specifically from the M1 region of Monkey B.
